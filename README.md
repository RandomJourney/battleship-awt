# Battleship

Source for Battleship using Java AWT.

Originally written for Java class at NMSU in 1997.

Update for Java 1.7. Release to Public Domain.

Ideas (keep it Java 8 compatible though):

1. Change color schemes to make them more subtle to reduce eye strain
2. Make it more intuitive for to orient the ship
3. Number them with letters and numbers so that it can be recorded as scores.
4. Making it possible to use of keyboard instead of mouse only for playing.
5. Create different AI difficulty levels (convention of 3).
6. Make an AI coach and compare with human's decisions for results.
7. Make it working with a server so that friends can play online.
